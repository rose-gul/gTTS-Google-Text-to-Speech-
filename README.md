# gTTS-Google-Text-to-Speech-
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and command-line tool that interfaces with Google Translate's text-to-speech API.  
A file-like object (bytestring) can be used to continue modifying the spoken MP3 data, or stdout. 
To feed to an external program, you can pre-generate Google Translate TTS request URLs. http://gtts.readthedocs.org/
